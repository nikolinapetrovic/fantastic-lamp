                <p>Budapest, city, capital of Hungary, and seat of Pest megye (county). The city is the political, administrative, industrial,
                    and commercial centre of Hungary. The site has been continuously settled since prehistoric times and is now the home of about
                    one-fifth of the country's population. Budapest is one of the most photogenic cities in Europe. The dramatic skyline that Budapest is
                    most famous for is peppered with 19th-century architectural wonders alongside the Danube River. Notable landmarks include the majestic
                    riverside Parliament Building and a collection of stunning basilicas. </p>

                    <p>I've been to Budapest, nearly two years ago. It's skyline was breathtaking. What i enjoyed the most in Budapest was the evening cruise
                        on the Danube River, although it was raining it was gorgeous. Besides the famous cultural
                        and natural landmarks, there are numerous festivals to enjoy, not to mention countless restaurants and bars greatly appreciated by tourists.
                        Already an affordable city, many of its sites are totally free! A breathtaking place, Budapest is nowadays included in many tours to Eastern Europe. </p>
