                    <p>Dresden is one of Germany's 16 political centres and the capital of Saxony. Dresden, nicknamed the Florence on the Elbe, is a vibrant
                        riverfront city filled with Baroque and Rococo architecture. A stroll through the Old Town takes you back to Dresden's opulent past,
                        with its grand palaces and cathedrals. Dresden's Frauenkirche, a symbol of the suffering of German civilians after its destruction in
                        World War II bombing and now of reconciliation, was consecrated Sunday after painstaking restoration. The church is perhaps Dresden's most
                        famous landmark and the image of it in ruins is known worldwide as a symbol of the destruction of World War II. </p>

                <p>The Zwinger is a palatial complex with gardens in Dresden, Germany. Designed by architect Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann, it is one of the most important
                    buildings of the Baroque period in Germany. Along with the Frauenkirche, the Zwinger is the most famous architectural monument of Dresden.

                    The name "Zwinger" goes back to the name used in the Middle Ages for a fortress part between the outer and inner fortress walls, even though the Zwinger no
                    longer had a function corresponding to the name at the start of construction. You can see the Zwinger in one of my pictures from Dresden.
