                <p>     My name is Nikolina, i am currently a student at "Ss.Cyril and Methodius" university in Skopje, North Macedonia.
                    I live in Tetovo , where i finished my elementary and high school education. Since the fifth grade
                    I've loved getting good grades and competing with students  my age at the local competitions especially in mathematics.
                    That is why i was spending most of my time studying, but in the past few years i started to enjoy spending time with people.
                    I really enjoy traveling and trying new things, meeting new people from all over the world
                    and getting to know them and their culture. <br>
                    You can see some of the countries in europe i have recently visited on the map and see some pictures
                    with short explanations.

                <p>     Another thing i like is exercising. I love being in good shape. If i am in a good physical shape,
                    i also feel better emotionally. Hiking is something i love because it keeps you in shape while seeing
                    new sides ,hanging out with friends and family and being in nature which is very fulfilling and it keeps your physical as
                    well as mental health in great shape.

                <p>
                    I know how until know i was explaining about loving to spend my time in nature but i also enjoy spending it if front of a computer .
                    Computers are something that i have been amazed with since young age. I was fascinated by the way computers work, display all those things that I was doing,
                    solving math problems in a few seconds for which i needed hours to calculate, all those websites and applications
                    with amazing functionalities and design. So i decided that one day i will learn how it works and will be able to
                    make something like that by myself. So here i am, studying computer science and i hope someday i will be able to make
                    something that will make our life easier in some way like my colleagues did until now.
